# PromptPro Project Milestones

## Project Overview

PromptPro is a tool designed to enhance team productivity and effectiveness when working with AI models like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini. It provides a centralized library for creating, managing, and sharing prompts, alongside features for tracking prompt performance and facilitating team collaboration. The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) focuses on delivering core functionalities for prompt organization, cross-platform use, basic performance tracking, and team sharing.

## Project Goals (MVP)

1.  **Efficient Prompt Management:** Enable users to easily create, save, categorize, tag, search, and copy prompts.
2.  **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Ensure prompts can be used effectively across major AI platforms with platform-specific guidance.
3.  **Performance Insight:** Implement a basic system for users to rate prompts, track usage frequency, and mark success/failure.
4.  **Team Collaboration:** Allow users to share prompts within teams, manage access via roles, and provide feedback through comments.
5.  **User-Friendly Experience:** Deliver a clean, intuitive, and mobile-responsive interface with simple onboarding.

## Phase Breakdown

### Phase 1: Core Development & Refinement

*   **Objective:** Finalize backend functionality, authentication, and core UI/UX.
*   **Key Tasks:**
    *   Finalize API endpoints (CRUD for prompts, collections, teams).
    *   Add validation and error handling to APIs.
    *   Complete authentication flow (login, signup, roles, sessions).
    *   Polish UI/UX for first-time users and responsiveness.
    *   Add onboarding elements.
    *   Test cross-platform prompt handling and consistency.
    *   [x] Design User Schema (fields like username, email, password hash, role).
    *   [x] Implement User Registration endpoint (`/api/auth/register`).
    *   [x] Implement User Login endpoint (`/api/auth/login`) - including session/token generation (via NextAuth CredentialsProvider).
    *   [ ] Implement session/token validation middleware for protected routes.

### Phase 2: Deployment & Initial Setup

*   **Objective:** Deploy the application to a hosting environment and set up necessary cloud services.
*   **Key Tasks:**
    *   Select and configure hosting platform (e.g., Vercel).
    *   Set up cloud database (e.g., MongoDB Atlas), configure access, and migrate schema.
    *   Configure production environment variables securely.
    *   Implement basic analytics and error monitoring.

### Phase 3: Beta Launch & Feedback Collection

*   **Objective:** Acquire initial beta users and gather feedback for iteration.
*   **Key Tasks:**
    *   Create a landing page and waitlist.
    *   Reach out to target communities (Reddit, Twitter/X, LinkedIn, Discord).
    *   Offer incentives for early adopters.
    *   Implement in-app feedback mechanisms.
    *   Set up a bug reporting system.
    *   Analyze usage analytics.
    *   Conduct user interviews (optional but recommended).
