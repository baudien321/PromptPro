# PromptPro Project Milestones

## Project Overview

PromptPro is a tool designed to enhance team productivity and effectiveness when working with AI models like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini. It provides a centralized library for creating, managing, and sharing prompts, alongside features for tracking prompt performance and facilitating team collaboration. The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) focuses on delivering core functionalities for prompt organization, cross-platform use, basic performance tracking, and team sharing.

## Project Goals (MVP)

1.  **Efficient Prompt Management:** Enable users to easily create, save, categorize, tag, search, and copy prompts.
2.  **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Ensure prompts can be used effectively across major AI platforms with platform-specific guidance.
3.  **Performance Insight:** Implement a basic system for users to rate prompts, track usage frequency, and mark success/failure.
4.  **Team Collaboration:** Allow users to share prompts within teams, manage access via roles, and provide feedback through comments.
5.  **User-Friendly Experience:** Deliver a clean, intuitive, and mobile-responsive interface with simple onboarding.

## Phase Breakdown

### Phase 1: Core Development & Refinement

*   **Objective:** Finalize backend functionality, authentication, and core UI/UX.
*   **Key Tasks:**
    *   Finalize API endpoints (CRUD for prompts, collections, teams).
    *   Add validation and error handling to APIs.
    *   Complete authentication flow (login, signup, roles, sessions).
    *   Polish UI/UX for first-time users and responsiveness.
    *   Add onboarding elements.
    *   Test cross-platform prompt handling and consistency.
    
    **1. Authentication Flow:**
        *   [x] Design User Schema (fields like username, email, password hash, role).
        *   [x] Implement User Registration endpoint (`/api/auth/register`).
        *   [x] Implement User Login endpoint (`/api/auth/login`) - including session/token generation (via NextAuth CredentialsProvider).
        *   [x] Implement session/token validation middleware for protected routes (via middleware.js).
        *   [x] Implement basic Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) checks (e.g., API helpers verifying user role in lib/permissions.js).
        *   [x] Implement Logout endpoint/functionality (clear session/token) (via next-auth/react signOut).
        *   [ ] Integrate Auth endpoints with Frontend (Login/Register forms - *verification needed*).

    **2. Core Prompt Features:**
        *   **Schema:**
            *   [x] Design Prompt Schema in `models/prompt.js` (title, text, creator, tags, platformCompatibility, timestamps).
        *   **API Endpoints:**
            *   [x] Implement `POST /api/prompts` (Create, requires auth).
            *   [x] Implement `GET /api/prompts` (Read List - user's prompts, requires auth).
            *   [x] Implement `GET /api/prompts/{id}` (Read Single, requires auth, check ownership).
            *   [x] Implement `PUT /api/prompts/{id}` (Update, requires auth + RBAC check).
            *   [x] Implement `DELETE /api/prompts/{id}` (Delete, requires auth + RBAC check).
        *   **Core UI:**
            *   [x] Create UI page/component for Listing Prompts.
            *   [x] Create UI page/component for Create/Edit Prompt Form.
            *   [x] Create UI page/component for Viewing Single Prompt.
            *   [x] Implement "Copy to Clipboard" button.
        *   **Basic Tagging & Platform UI:**
            *   [x] Update Form UI for Tag input.
            *   [x] Update Form UI for Platform Compatibility input.
            *   [x] Display Tags/Platforms in List/View UI.

    **3. API Validation & Error Handling (Ongoing):**
        *   [x] Add input validation & error handling to Prompt endpoints.
        *   [x] Add input validation & error handling to Team endpoints (when built).

    **4. Core UI/UX - Structure & Responsiveness (Ongoing):**
        *   [x] Set up basic Dashboard layout.
        *   [x] Implement basic navigation.
        *   [x] Ensure basic mobile responsiveness for core views.

    **5. Cross-Platform Testing (Manual - Ongoing):**
        *   [ ] Test copy/paste into ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini.

    **6. Refactoring & Cleanup:**
        *   [x] Refactor DB Connection to shared `lib/mongoose.js`.
        *   [x] Review `pages/auth/signup.js` and `pages/auth/signin.js` for alignment with backend (Done, marked pending verification).
        *   [x] Review/Remove `pages/api/auth/signup.js` if unused/duplicate.

### Phase 2: Deployment & Initial Setup

*   **Objective:** Deploy the application to a hosting environment and set up necessary cloud services.
*   **Key Tasks (Detailed Steps):**
    *   **1. Hosting Platform Setup (Assuming Vercel):**
        *   [ ] Confirm Vercel is the chosen hosting platform.
        *   [ ] Create a Vercel account and a new project.
        *   [ ] Connect the project's Git repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab) to the Vercel project for automatic deployments.
        *   [ ] Verify Vercel's build settings (usually automatic for Next.js).
        *   [ ] Trigger an initial deployment to Vercel to ensure the build process works.
        *   [ ] (Optional) Configure a custom domain name in Vercel settings.
    *   **2. Cloud Database Setup (Assuming MongoDB Atlas):**
        *   [ ] Create a MongoDB Atlas account and set up a new cluster (a free tier is often sufficient to start).
        *   [ ] Create a database user specifically for the application with strong credentials and appropriate read/write permissions.
        *   [ ] Configure Network Access rules in Atlas to allow connections from:
            *   Vercel's deployment IPs (Vercel provides guidance on this).
            *   Your local IP address for testing/development against the cloud DB.
        *   [ ] Obtain the production database connection string (URI) from Atlas.
        *   [ ] Verify Mongoose models (`models/*.js`) are finalized for the initial schema.
    *   **3. Environment Variable Configuration:**
        *   [ ] Identify all required environment variables for production:
            *   `MONGODB_URI` (from Atlas step)
            *   `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` (generate a strong, unique secret)
            *   `NEXTAUTH_URL` (the canonical URL of the deployed application)
            *   `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` / `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` (if using Google OAuth)
            *   Any other external API keys or service credentials.
        *   [ ] Add these variables securely to the Vercel project's environment variable settings (under the "Production" environment).
        *   [ ] Double-check that `.env.local` (or similar local files) are listed in `.gitignore`.
    *   **4. Deployment & Verification:**
        *   [ ] Trigger a new deployment on Vercel (this will now use the production environment variables).
        *   [ ] Test core application functionality on the deployed Vercel URL:
            *   User registration and login (including OAuth if configured).
            *   Database connection (e.g., creating/viewing prompts).
            *   Protected routes access.
    *   **5. Basic Analytics Implementation:**
        *   [ ] Choose an analytics provider (e.g., Vercel Analytics - simple integration, Google Analytics - more features).
        *   [ ] Integrate the chosen provider:
            *   Vercel Analytics: Enable via Vercel dashboard.
            *   Google Analytics: Add tracking code/SDK, typically in `pages/_app.js`.
        *   [ ] Verify analytics data is being received in the provider's dashboard after deployment and some usage.
    *   **6. Basic Error Monitoring Implementation:**
        *   [ ] Choose an error monitoring service (e.g., Sentry, LogRocket, or utilize Vercel's built-in logging features).
        *   [ ] Integrate the chosen service/SDK if necessary (often involves adding configuration to `next.config.js` or `_app.js`).
        *   [ ] Configure the service to capture both frontend and backend (API route/server-side) errors.
        *   [ ] (Optional) Trigger a test error in the deployed application to confirm it's captured by the monitoring service.

### Phase 3: Beta Launch & Feedback Collection

*   **Objective:** Acquire initial beta users and gather feedback for iteration.
*   **Key Tasks:**
    *   Create a landing page and waitlist.
    *   Reach out to target communities (Reddit, Twitter/X, LinkedIn, Discord).
    *   Offer incentives for early adopters.
    *   Implement in-app feedback mechanisms.
    *   Set up a bug reporting system.
    *   Analyze usage analytics.
    *   Conduct user interviews (optional but recommended).
