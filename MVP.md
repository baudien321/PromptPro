MVP Core Features (B2B Focus)
Primary Goal: Solve pain points for teams using AI models (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) by streamlining prompt creation, organization, and collaboration.

1. Centralized Prompt Library
Team Workspaces: Create shared spaces for departments (e.g., Marketing, Engineering).

Version Control: Track prompt iterations and revert to previous versions.

Tagging & Search: Filter prompts by model (e.g., "Claude-3"), use case, or creator.

2. Cross-Platform Compatibility
Pre-built templates optimized for ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.

Auto-format prompts for specific models (prevents manual adjustments).

3. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Define permissions: Admin, Editor, Viewer.

Restrict access to sensitive prompts (e.g., sales scripts, proprietary workflows).

4. Basic Performance Tracking
Prompt Analytics Dashboard: Track usage metrics (e.g., most-used prompts, user activity).

Success Metrics: Let teams flag prompts as "Effective" or "Needs Improvement."

5. Team Collaboration Tools
Comments/Annotations: Discuss prompts inline (e.g., "Update tone to match brand guidelines").

Approval Workflows: Submit prompts for manager review before deployment.

6. Secure Sharing
Share prompts via encrypted links (expiration dates, password protection).

Export prompts to CSV/JSON for external audits.

7. Audit Logs
Track changes, logins, and prompt access for compliance.

Paywall Strategy (B2B Pricing)
Freemium â†’ Team Tiers

Free Tier (Small Teams)

1 workspace, 3 members, 100 prompt saves/month.

Basic analytics and ChatGPT/Gemini support.

Pro Team ($49/user/month)

Unlimited workspaces, custom RBAC, advanced analytics.

Priority support & compliance features (audit logs, SSO).

Enterprise (Custom Pricing)

Dedicated instance, SLA guarantees, API access.

On-prem deployment options.

Competitive Differentiation
Most B2B AI tools (e.g., Akkio, Promptitude) focus on workflow automation, not team-centric prompt management. Your MVP stands out by:

Cross-Model Governance: Manage prompts for ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini in one hub.

Collaboration-First Design: Approval workflows and comments reduce Slack/email chaos.

Compliance Ready: Audit logs and RBAC cater to regulated industries (finance, healthcare).
